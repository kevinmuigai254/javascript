<p class="a">CHAPTER ONE</p>
<p class="a1">
It was the opening school day when mamba was to join highschool.The day began dramatically as mamba needed to get a head shave as per the school rules of the new school he was to join,to his bad luck there was a power blackout in the whole area.So all barber shops were not functioning.The rules of the new school were crystal clear that every student should join the school with their heads shining like the buttock of a newly born baby.They had to improvise ,his father had to give him a quick shave with scissors.

<p class="a3">
mamba:i can't believe i am losing my afro due to school rules.Whoever invented school rules should just go to hell
(mamba said to himself)
</p>

After the scissors shave which left him looking like a meme they proceeded to school for admission.There was a heavy security check in school to ensure no one was admitted with an illegal item.The illegal items included drugs,snacks and home clothes.Before this rule was created students could come to school with home clothes.It was until some of the students  came to school with clothes more expensive than their schoolfees while some teachers were repeating  the same clothes for almost a week,that they found it nessecary to put the precaution.There was also a no snacks policy and every student was to eat school provided food.During the search mamba was caught trying to sneak a phone.The only thing that saved him was that the teacher on duty and her mother were churchmates so they took the phone and spared him the punishment.He later joined the other students for orientation ,which took a week.During this period they were introduced to all the teachers.They were also taken round the school.The school was so big that some students once tried to escape ,after jumping the first fence and going they thought that they had made it out only to find out they were still in school but in the teachers quatters.Mamba was having a rough time as he was still experiencing homesickness.Learning started and the worst part for mamba was during night preps.Where they were to be in class doing personal studies without a teacher.Mamba used to sleep during the night preps and eventually his day of reckoning arrived .It was a fine evening everything was going on well untill mamba decided to take a nap.He had told his deskmate to be alert and to wake him up incase the teacher on duty came to class.Well his deskmate forgot and also fell asleep.The next thing mamba remembers is a hot slap.
